Flying doesn’t have to be stressful, but let’s be honest: forgetting something important can quickly turn your dream trip into a nightmare. Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered! Here are five important things to do before you head to the airport to make your next flight as smooth (and fun!) as possible.

1.⁠ ⁠Get Your Docs in Check
Don’t be that person frantically searching for their boarding pass at security! Double-check your passport, visa (if you need one), and travel docs before you leave. Save digital copies on your phone, and maybe even print a backup—you know, just in case.

2.⁠ ⁠Pack Like a Pro
Your carry-on is your lifeline mid-flight. Snacks? Check. A water bottle you can refill? Check. Headphones, charger, and a good book? Triple check. Oh, and don’t forget to pack your liquids smartly so you’re not the one holding up the TSA line!

3.⁠ ⁠Dress for Comfort (and Security)
Want to breeze through security like a pro? Go for slip-on shoes and keep your outfit comfy but layered. Planes can go from freezing to stuffy real quick, so dress smart to stay cozy all flight long.

4.⁠ ⁠Download Wingle (Seriously, It’s a Game-Changer)
Ever sat on a flight wondering who else is on board? Wingle is the app that lets you find out! It’s perfect for meeting like-minded travelers, swapping tips, or even just making small talk to pass the time. Set up your profile, browse who’s flying with you, and connect on your terms. Trust us, it’s way more fun than scrolling Instagram for the hundredth time.

5.⁠ ⁠Plan Your In-Flight Entertainment
Long flights = boredom city if you don’t plan ahead. Download your favorite movies, binge-worthy podcasts, or that e-book you’ve been meaning to start. Bonus tip: bring a power bank because the last thing you want is a dead battery halfway through the flight.

And there you have it—five super-simple things to do before takeoff that’ll make your travel day way less stressful. Happy flying!
