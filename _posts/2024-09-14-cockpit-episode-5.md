The launch has been very successful. It's been a huge win and something we’re immensely proud of. But if we want to turn Wingle into the success we envision, this is just the tiny start.

We’ve been running like crazy and focusing all our energy the past few months on the launch and initial summer traction, but now that “Phase 1” is over, we’re starting a new one where not only do we need to keep up with momentum, but increase it.

And with this new Phase comes the critical question: “Chicken or Pasta?”. Or in other words: Do we keep on doing what we’ve been doing these past months or try something new? Seatback advertising, the “pasta” of our user acquisition, is working very well for us and in a cost effective manner, but it is still quite an expensive channel to keep feeding every month.

So as summer comes to an end, as long trips give way to “weekend escapes” and busy cities become the preferred destinations, it’s time to try some “chicken”. And by chicken, we mean more “on the street” activations, promotions, guerrilla actions, competitions… All with the ultimate goal of continuing to build on the traction of these first 3 months and achieving longer engagement with our users.

So to the initial question: Chicken or Pasta?

Our answer: Chicken with a side of Pasta

And, as always, here are the highlights of the month!
