Welcome to Ep. 2 of “cockpit diaries”, as we get closer to Wingle’s launch on July 1st.

A couple of weeks ago a friend asked: “how’s Wingle going?” and “what does the process feel like?”. “It feels like an onion”, was the answer 😂. Now, before you think what are these people talking about, hear us out:

When we began with Wingle, focus was on developing the core product; our app, and defining who we were as a brand. Over the past months, the complexity and “layers” of Wingle have been growing quickly. It's no longer only about the app and the brand, but also about social media, outreach strategy, affiliate program, partnerships, integrations with suppliers, fundraising and financing, admin, PR, advertising… adding layer after layer to Wingle. And while it would be too much to say that some of these “layers” have started to run by themselves, it feels good to see how they pick up momentum.

On a personal side, it was a tense month. As the countdown to July 1st gets closer and closer, the pressure also builds up. We’re racing to have the Android app released in the coming weeks, prioritizing functionalities and use cases, pushing to get partners onboard, deciding the content and tone for social media and just generally, 100 other things in parallel. And let’s be honest; we both have very different ways of looking at things. While this specifically is the “secret sauce” for Wingle to work, it's also sometimes a cause of dispute. While Pol is a very detail-oriented person, Iñigo is more of a macro-perspective guy.

But the good thing is that we’re both quite vocal in sharing how we feel and have no problem in discussing and clarifying issues openly. Our “makeshift therapy sessions” this past month have been great to clear the air 😉. At the end of the day, it's the mix of that macro and micro view of things that makes Wingle work.

🚨 In the essence of time, we’ll keep the rest of the updates short:🚨

📱 We’re launching the Android version of Wingle in the next couple of weeks

👩‍✈️ We’ve launched an affiliate program for cabin crews, so they can promote Wingle and get rewarded for it (please share any cabin crew contacts)

📸 Social Media activation is live as of Monday 10th (check @lets_wingle)

🎬 We had our first Wingle “shooting” last week, generating some very cool content (big shoutout to our friends converted into actors for a day)

😤 We’ve had to scramble last minute to change our ads campaign in an airline because they considered them too “aggressive”

📆 Wingle was at South Summit in Madrid last week and we’ve been invited as startup to the World Aviation Festival in Amsterdam in October, one of the biggest global aviation fairs

💻 We have a new, simple, cleaner and more functional web

Ready for takeoff!
