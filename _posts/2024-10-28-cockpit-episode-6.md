Hello and happy Halloween!

What’s one of the spookiest travel situations? Picture yourself with an itinerary with several stopovers, 30 min connections and… checked in luggage!! If everything that needs to happen works out fine, you are in for a treat. If something goes slightly wrong, then what a trick… 😉

This month, we’ve been building ourselves an itinerary with Wingle where there are many different moving pieces, many things to do across all fronts and lots of them where we don’t know how they will turn out. But it’s no fun if it’s all smooth sailing, so we’re in for it! Over the coming months we’ll see how this itinerary turns out.

Our itinerary takes us across evolutions in the app, new partners and services, a change in our marketing and activations strategy, the first Wingle hire, lots of potential partnerships that will require a great deal of cold calling and pursuing and… a fundraising round!

And, as every month, here are the highlights for October!

🤝We attended the [World Aviation Festival](https://www.linkedin.com/company/world-aviation-festival/) in Amsterdam in early October as an invited startup. We made new connections with airlines, spoke about Wingle and unlocked new partnerships!

🧠The app has evolved to understand what moment of the travel experience you’re at and offer you the best services for that step of your journey (i.e. airport lounge)

🧳Baggage storage is now available for all Wingle users

📹We’ve evolved our content style in Instagram publications. If you don’t follow us yet, make sure you do on https://lnkd.in/d4nG97Tj

📺We were featured in Mexico’s ADN40 TV news network! https://lnkd.in/dKA6YSdp

And also on several IG travel pages with +1M followers!

🧑‍✈️Miguel Icaza joined Wingle from Miami Ad School to push marketing & activations. 

Stay tuned for what we'll be launching...
