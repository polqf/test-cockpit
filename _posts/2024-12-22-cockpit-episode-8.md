And just like that, we’ve reached the end of 2024. Crazy. It’s been 1 year, but it’s felt like 3!

If someone had told us 1 year ago that we would be closing 2024 with almost 20,000 active users (only 5 months after launch), we would've never believed it!! We are so thankful to all the Winglers who have made this possible 🫶🏼🫶🏼.

There's still so much to do and to improve. Our goal is to make sure that whatever flight you're on, you will always find another Wingler to chat to. It's ambitious, but we're convinced that we we'll make it with your help.

As we come to the last days of the year, we’re tying up everything so Wingle can run for some days on “autopilot” while we try to get some very needed rest. Check out what's been happening this month:

🚌Wingle is advertised on all Terravision buses in Milan and Rome taking passengers to and from the airport
🍸 The “make your flight better” services keep improving, with a huge offering of VIP lounges, instant compensation in case of delays, destination events…
👨🏽‍💻Campaign in WeWork Spain locations, showcasing Wingle to their users
🎅🏽First month of in-house content production, with a special feature and series on “Wingle’s Santa”; very happy with the traction
🌱Things are cooking for Jan 2025; we’ll let you know what they are when they launch in the new year!

Enjoy the holiday season and have a great start to 2025 from the cockpit!
