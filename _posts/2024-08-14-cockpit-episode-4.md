Summers are a period to wind down, relax and disconnect… or not. This year, our summer looks very different, as Wingle speeds up, becomes more visible and grows more and more.

With all that has been happening this month and the initial traction, we are so grateful for being able to do this, for seeing how all the hard work starts to translate into results and we are so excited for all that’s coming.

This is the summary of this first full month!

🎶get in the vibe of your destination with our music playlists; curated by BMG

🤝even before your flight, you can now meet other Winglers in person at the airport!

🗞mom, dad, we’re in the news!!!!

📺mom, dad, we’re in the news (again)!!!

💥we’re over 6.5k users!

🤳record set at 21 people using Wingle at the same time in a flight from London to Malaga!

💺seatback ad campaign secured for September in an airline to be disclosed soon!

📱evolution of both iOS and Android apps, adding features and fixing glitches; Android is picking up pace

👩‍🍳something’s cooking for September…

Working across summer is not anyone’s preferred option, but when you’re working on a project as exciting as Wingle, when you’re building something that is yours, that you truly believe in and that you see that starts to generate traction, then work is less work. And if work can be done from different places, different settings and with the flexibility of making timings work, what else can we ask for.

And with all this… we’ll leave you to continue sipping on your cold drink, enjoying the summer sun and Wingling on your flight back!!

Soundtrack of the month: La Gracia by The Cat Empire
