“You guys are hustlers. That’s one of the things that I like most about what you’re doing”. This is what an investor recently told us during a call.

And honestly, we love that adjective. We often get asked what being entrepreneurs feels like, what a day in the life looks like… and “hustle” might be just the word that sums it all up.

Hustle is waking up every morning and deciding who you will be cold-calling, it’s building the next marketing campaign, it’s shaking off your shyness and recording the next reel, it’s pushing ahead with the next tech integration and app development, it’s thinking about the next move that will allow you to monetize better….

It’s all this and it’s doing it every day, even when you get rejected, when you get no answer or when the great idea doesn’t quite work out right.

We’re hustlers. It’s fun, it’s dynamic, it’s exciting. But hustling is also extremely tiring. Today, as we’re writing this, it’s one of those days when energy levels are running a bit low. And this “Cockpit Diaries” felt like the right time to recognize that not every day is a sunny day and how resilience, more than genius ideas, pushes projects forward.
