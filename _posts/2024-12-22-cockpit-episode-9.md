As the first (and arguably, the longest) month of the year comes to an end, we’re back in the cockpit with the latest updates and general thoughts! 🙌

While some seem to have “cracked the year” this first month already, with posts on “new years resolutions”, “strategy”, “roadmaps and goals” flooding LinkedIn, we have not. 🤷‍♂️ 😉

What we do know is that for us, 2025 will be the year of growing the Wingle user base exponentially. It has to be the year of boosting brand awareness in our core markets these first few months (Spain, Italy, France) but also growing it to new countries and geographies. In 2025, Wingle will be available for all flights around the world. It will be critical to understand which markets can work best in order to focus our efforts and investment.

And how will we reach these goals? Well, we’re already working on some cool campaigns for the full year, both in our core markets and new regions; ads in airplanes, PR, collabs with airlines, organic traction, social media (the big black box)… 

But we’re not going to lie. 

We don’t have the crystal ball 🔮. We know (and embrace) the fact that a part of what we do will be trial and error, of learning as we go, of testing, of some big hits but also of several mess-ups. But that’s how we beat all expectations for 2024. And that’s how we’ll crack 2025; adapting as we go, trusting metrics and equally, trusting our gut feeling! Let’s go!!!
