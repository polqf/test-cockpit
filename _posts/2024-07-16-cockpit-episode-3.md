Time flies!! It’s already Ep. 3 of our “cockpit diaries” and week 3 since launch!

Monday July 1st felt as if we were pushing a big red button and screaming “GO!” After all the effort of the past 1+ yr, it was showtime!

In the weeks building up to launch week we focused on really doubling down on our content generation and social media presence together with our agency.

When we’re in the viewer side, we tend to underestimate what it takes to create attractive, engaging and quality content not once, but every day of every week of every year… After being in the “creator” side these past months, we can only say 👏 to everyone who does it for a living.

Launch week can be summarized into:

🫨a controlled frenzy

🤳becoming TikTokers for a day

📈the adrenaline rush of watching downloads grow

🛫obsessive tracking of every Vueling flight with ads

👨‍✈️ “wannabe” air traffic controllers

🚨sudden stress of fixing glitches

📱frustration with pending reviews of the Android app

💸hype of new investors joining us

💡creativity spikes

🦐admiration of the British tourists in Mallorca

2 full weeks after launch and the initial feelings are very positive. The pieces are falling into place: downloads are increasing at a faster and faster pace, we’re having several Winglers on every

[Vueling Airlines](https://www.linkedin.com/company/vueling-airlines/) flight with seatback ads, our user base is growing all over Europe, we’re having organic interest in Wingle, we’ve finally launched the Android app and we have some cool new product features to be released very soon!!

But of course, it is not all rosy. In these first weeks we’ve had a first glitch (all fixed) that caused Wingle’s core product, the chat, to be unavailable for several hours and we’ve been battling to get the Android app released a couple weeks later than expected. On a side note, a quick request for you to update your Wingle app to the latest version 🙏.

All in all, we’re pumped and excited. The launch has given us that extra showtime boost!
