As proud members of the Spanish entrepreneurial ecosystem, we could not miss being at this year's South Summit in Madrid.

Let's be candid: the question from many people (and honestly, also from ourselves) was whether it made sense for such a young startup (Wingle is launching commercially this summer) to attend such an event at this stage. We had doubts on whether we would actually find an interest from the corporates and investors and frankly, whether it was a good use of our time.

The answer: for sure it's worth it. We will of course not leave the event with a new investor signed onto the project, nor a "done deal" partnership. But we will leave (and have already) with interesting leads for opportunities with corporates (airlines and airports), with contacts for new investors, with face-to-face meetings with people we had only met on calls before, and with a broader view of the startup ecosystem; whether for now or later. 

Above all, it is useful in getting the Wingle name "out there" right from the start. It's useful in beginning to talk to VCs and investors and starting to open conversations for future rounds down the road. And it's useful in taking some time to zoom out from our day-to-day rush and look at what else there's out there.

So... having said this, let's connect if you're around!
