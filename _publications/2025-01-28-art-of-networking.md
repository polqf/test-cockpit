Think networking only happens at conferences or on LinkedIn? Think again! Your next flight might just be your best opportunity to make meaningful professional connections. Here’s why:

#### **1. Flights Create a Unique Opportunity**

In today’s world of notifications and busy schedules, uninterrupted hours are rare. On a flight, you and your fellow passengers are in a unique, shared space—disconnected from everyday distractions.

#### **2. Wingle Helps Break the Ice**

Starting a conversation with a stranger can be intimidating, but **[Wingle](https://letswingle.com)** makes it easy. The app lets you browse profiles of fellow passengers and connect with those who share your professional interests. You can chat before or during the flight, making networking feel natural.

#### **3. Who Should You Network With?**

- **Fellow Professionals:** You never know if the person in the next seat is working in the same field.
- **Entrepreneurs:** Flights often attract business owners traveling for meetings or events. Why not brainstorm together?
- **Experts:** Imagine discussing your next big idea with someone who’s already mastered it.

#### **4. Practical Networking Tips for Flights**

- **Start with an App Like Wingle:** Search for passengers who share your industry or interests.
- **Be Respectful of Privacy:** Not everyone will want to network, and that’s okay.
- **Follow Up:** Make sure to exchange contact details and send a follow-up message after the flight.
