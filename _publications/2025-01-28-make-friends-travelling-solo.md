Traveling solo can be one of the most liberating experiences, but it doesn’t mean you have to be alone the entire time. Making connections along the way is not only possible but also enriching. Whether you’re exploring a new city or flying to your next destination, here are five tips to help you meet like-minded travelers:

#### 1. **Join Group Activities**

From walking tours to cooking classes, group activities are a fantastic way to meet others with shared interests. Websites like [Airbnb Experiences](https://www.airbnb.com/s/experiences) or apps like Meetup are treasure troves of local events and activities. Bonus: you’ll learn something new while making friends!

#### 2. **Stay in Social Accommodations**

Hostels and co-living spaces often have common areas and group activities designed for socializing. Even boutique hotels have started organizing events like happy hours to encourage mingling.

#### 3. **Use Travel Apps Like Wingle**

Solo travelers often find flights to be solitary… but not anymore! With **[Wingle](https://letswingle.com)**, you can connect with fellow passengers before your flight takes off.

Sometimes, all it takes is a smile and a friendly question. Ask a fellow traveler about their itinerary, or comment on something you both observe. Airports, trains, and even cafes are full of potential new connections.

#### 5. **Volunteer or Attend Local Events**

Volunteering with local organizations or attending cultural events gives you a chance to meet residents and travelers alike. It’s an immersive way to understand the local culture and build friendships that last.
