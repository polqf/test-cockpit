**Air travel often means hours of downtime**, but it doesn’t have to be wasted. Why not use the time to **connect with others**? **Wingle**—a travel app that’s quietly changing the in-flight experience—offers a **simple and organic way to connect** with fellow passengers on your flight.

---

### **Here’s how it works:**  
Before your journey, you can:  
- **Set up a profile**  
- **Share your interests**  
- **See who else is flying the same route**  

The app lets you **browse profiles** and decide if you want to start a conversation. Whether you’re into **books, travel tips, or professional networking**, Wingle makes it easy to **connect on your terms**.

---

### **What makes it different?**  
- **No pressure**: You decide how much (or little) you want to engage.  
- If a **quick chat** is all you’re after, Wingle keeps it simple and lets you move at your own pace.

Next time you’re flying, consider **turning a long flight into an opportunity for meaningful connections**. Because sometimes, **the best part of traveling isn’t just the destination—it’s the unexpected stories you create along the way.**
