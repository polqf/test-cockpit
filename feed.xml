Crazy. It’s been 1 year, but it’s felt like 3!</p> <p>If someone had told us 1 year ago that we would be closing 2024 with almost 20,000 active users (only 5 months after launch), we would’ve never believed it!! We are so thankful to all the Winglers who have made this possible 🫶🏼🫶🏼.</p> <p>There’s still so much to do and to improve. Our goal is to make sure that whatever flight you’re on, you will always find another Wingler to chat to. It’s ambitious, but we’re convinced that we we’ll make it with your help.</p> <p>As we come to the last days of the year, we’re tying up everything so Wingle can run for some days on “autopilot” while we try to get some very needed rest. Check out what’s been happening this month:</p> <p>🚌Wingle is advertised on all Terravision buses in Milan and Rome taking passengers to and from the airport 🍸 The “make your flight better” services keep improving, with a huge offering of VIP lounges, instant compensation in case of delays, destination events… 👨🏽‍💻Campaign in WeWork Spain locations, showcasing Wingle to their users 🎅🏽First month of in-house content production, with a special feature and series on “Wingle’s Santa”; very happy with the traction 🌱Things are cooking for Jan 2025; we’ll let you know what they are when they launch in the new year!</p> <p>Enjoy the holiday season and have a great start to 2025 from the cockpit!</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lets-wingle_wingle-cockpit-diaries-episode-8-rearview-activity-7276888029200306176-zXjd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">On LinkedIn</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Cockpit Diaries"/><category term="cockpit-diaries"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cockpit diaries series]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Episode 9: It’s in the air</title><link href="https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-9/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Episode 9: It’s in the air"/><published>2024-12-22T12:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-12-22T12:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-9</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-9/"><![CDATA[<p>As the first (and arguably, the longest) month of the year comes to an end, we’re back in the cockpit with the latest updates and general thoughts! 🙌</p> <p>While some seem to have “cracked the year” this first month already, with posts on “new years resolutions”, “strategy”, “roadmaps and goals” flooding LinkedIn, we have not. 🤷‍♂️ 😉</p> <p>What we do know is that for us, 2025 will be the year of growing the Wingle user base exponentially. It has to be the year of boosting brand awareness in our core markets these first few months (Spain, Italy, France) but also growing it to new countries and geographies. In 2025, Wingle will be available for all flights around the world. It will be critical to understand which markets can work best in order to focus our efforts and investment.</p> <p>And how will we reach these goals? Well, we’re already working on some cool campaigns for the full year, both in our core markets and new regions; ads in airplanes, PR, collabs with airlines, organic traction, social media (the big black box)…</p> <p>But we’re not going to lie.</p> <p>We don’t have the crystal ball 🔮. We know (and embrace) the fact that a part of what we do will be trial and error, of learning as we go, of testing, of some big hits but also of several mess-ups. But that’s how we beat all expectations for 2024. And that’s how we’ll crack 2025; adapting as we go, trusting metrics and equally, trusting our gut feeling! Let’s go!!!</p> <p>🛫 IT’S IN THE AIR 🛫</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lets-wingle_wingle-cockpit-diaries-episode-9-its-activity-7288511494617505793-rYOK/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">On LinkedIn</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Cockpit Diaries"/><category term="cockpit-diaries"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cockpit diaries series]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Episode 7: Hustle</title><link href="https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-7/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Episode 7: Hustle"/><published>2024-11-26T12:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2024-11-26T12:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-7</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-7/"><![CDATA[<p>“You guys are hustlers. That’s one of the things that I like most about what you’re doing”. This is what an investor recently told us during a call.</p> <p>And honestly, we love that adjective. We often get asked what being entrepreneurs feels like, what a day in the life looks like… and “hustle” might be just the word that sums it all up.</p> <p>Hustle is waking up every morning and deciding who you will be cold-calling, it’s building the next marketing campaign, it’s shaking off your shyness and recording the next reel, it’s pushing ahead with the next tech integration and app development, it’s thinking about the next move that will allow you to monetize better….</p> <p>It’s all this and it’s doing it every day, even when you get rejected, when you get no answer or when the great idea doesn’t quite work out right.</p> <p>We’re hustlers. It’s fun, it’s dynamic, it’s exciting. But hustling is also extremely tiring. Today, as we’re writing this, it’s one of those days when energy levels are running a bit low. And this “Cockpit Diaries” felt like the right time to recognize that not every day is a sunny day and how resilience, more than genius ideas, pushes projects forward.</p> <p>Check out what we were up to this month!:</p> <p>🍸Welcome VIP lounge access through Wingle!</p> <p>📹Renewed content style on social media has driven engagement and traction https://lnkd.in/d4nG97Tj</p> <p>🧑‍✈️A more rewarding Wingle Pilots program is live; check it out if you haven’t yet!</p> <p>📈Even without seatback ads, we have kept the same user growth rate as previous months!</p> <p>📰Wingle continues to attract media attention, with features in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/la-vanguardia/">La Vanguardia</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/dubai-eye-103-8/">Dubai Eye 103.8</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/la-voz-de-galicia/">La Voz De Galicia S.A.</a>, driving 000s of downloads</p> <p>🚌For December, we’ve secured an agreement with a top transport provider from Italian airports to cities, guaranteeing 850k impacts</p> <p><strong><em>BONUS: With the track record and traction since launch validating the case for Wingle (c. 15k active users as of today, start of recurring revenues) we will soon be opening a fundraising round to take Wingle to new heights.

Picture yourself with an itinerary with several stopovers, 30 min connections and… checked in luggage!! If everything that needs to happen works out fine, you are in for a treat. If something goes slightly wrong, then what a trick… 😉</p> <p>This month, we’ve been building ourselves an itinerary with Wingle where there are many different moving pieces, many things to do across all fronts and lots of them where we don’t know how they will turn out. But it’s no fun if it’s all smooth sailing, so we’re in for it! Over the coming months we’ll see how this itinerary turns out.</p> <p>Our itinerary takes us across evolutions in the app, new partners and services, a change in our marketing and activations strategy, the first Wingle hire, lots of potential partnerships that will require a great deal of cold calling and pursuing and… a fundraising round!</p> <p>And, as every month, here are the highlights for October!</p> <p>🤝We attended the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/world-aviation-festival/">World Aviation Festival</a> in Amsterdam in early October as an invited startup. We made new connections with airlines, spoke about Wingle and unlocked new partnerships!</p> <p>🧠The app has evolved to understand what moment of the travel experience you’re at and offer you the best services for that step of your journey (i.e. airport lounge)</p> <p>🧳Baggage storage is now available for all Wingle users</p> <p>📹We’ve evolved our content style in Instagram publications.

It’s been a huge win and something we’re immensely proud of. But if we want to turn Wingle into the success we envision, this is just the tiny start.</p> <p>We’ve been running like crazy and focusing all our energy the past few months on the launch and initial summer traction, but now that “Phase 1” is over, we’re starting a new one where not only do we need to keep up with momentum, but increase it.</p> <p>And with this new Phase comes the critical question: “Chicken or Pasta?”. Or in other words: Do we keep on doing what we’ve been doing these past months or try something new? Seatback advertising, the “pasta” of our user acquisition, is working very well for us and in a cost effective manner, but it is still quite an expensive channel to keep feeding every month.</p> <p>So as summer comes to an end, as long trips give way to “weekend escapes” and busy cities become the preferred destinations, it’s time to try some “chicken”. And by chicken, we mean more “on the street” activations, promotions, guerrilla actions, competitions… All with the ultimate goal of continuing to build on the traction of these first 3 months and achieving longer engagement with our users.</p> <p>So to the initial question: Chicken or Pasta?</p> <p>Our answer: Chicken with a side of Pasta</p> <p>And, as always, here are the highlights of the month!</p> <p>💺Wingle is in Iberia Express and Vueling airplanes this month! 000s of pax have met on flights to Amsterdam, Ibiza, Las Palmas, Dublin, London or Rome!</p> <p>🍸lounge access, compensations in case of flight delays and new experiences are now available for all Wingle users to make the flight and travel experience more enjoyable!</p> <p>📰we’re featured in Conde Nast Traveler!</p> <p>👩‍✈Wingle’s Pilot program is out!

This year, our summer looks very different, as Wingle speeds up, becomes more visible and grows more and more.</p> <p>With all that has been happening this month and the initial traction, we are so grateful for being able to do this, for seeing how all the hard work starts to translate into results and we are so excited for all that’s coming.</p> <p>This is the summary of this first full month!</p> <p>🎶get in the vibe of your destination with our music playlists; curated by BMG</p> <p>🤝even before your flight, you can now meet other Winglers in person at the airport!</p> <p>🗞mom, dad, we’re in the news!!!!</p> <p>📺mom, dad, we’re in the news (again)!!!</p> <p>💥we’re over 6.5k users!</p> <p>🤳record set at 21 people using Wingle at the same time in a flight from London to Malaga!</p> <p>💺seatback ad campaign secured for September in an airline to be disclosed soon!</p> <p>📱evolution of both iOS and Android apps, adding features and fixing glitches; Android is picking up pace</p> <p>👩‍🍳something’s cooking for September…</p> <p>Working across summer is not anyone’s preferred option, but when you’re working on a project as exciting as Wingle, when you’re building something that is yours, that you truly believe in and that you see that starts to generate traction, then work is less work. And if work can be done from different places, different settings and with the flexibility of making timings work, what else can we ask for.</p> <p>And with all this… we’ll leave you to continue sipping on your cold drink, enjoying the summer sun and Wingling on your flight back!!</p> <p>Soundtrack of the month: La Gracia by The Cat Empire</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lets-wingle_wingle-cockpit-diaries-episode-4-gear-activity-7231208311742767104-NI47/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">On LinkedIn</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Cockpit Diaries"/><category term="cockpit-diaries"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cockpit diaries series]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Episode 3: Takeoff!</title><link href="https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Episode 3: Takeoff!"/><published>2024-07-16T13:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-07-16T13:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-3/"><![CDATA[<p>Time flies!!

Now, before you think what are these people talking about, hear us out:</p> <p>When we began with Wingle, focus was on developing the core product; our app, and defining who we were as a brand. Over the past months, the complexity and “layers” of Wingle have been growing quickly. It’s no longer only about the app and the brand, but also about social media, outreach strategy, affiliate program, partnerships, integrations with suppliers, fundraising and financing, admin, PR, advertising… adding layer after layer to Wingle. And while it would be too much to say that some of these “layers” have started to run by themselves, it feels good to see how they pick up momentum.</p> <p>On a personal side, it was a tense month. As the countdown to July 1st gets closer and closer, the pressure also builds up. We’re racing to have the Android app released in the coming weeks, prioritizing functionalities and use cases, pushing to get partners onboard, deciding the content and tone for social media and just generally, 100 other things in parallel. And let’s be honest; we both have very different ways of looking at things. While this specifically is the “secret sauce” for Wingle to work, it’s also sometimes a cause of dispute. While Pol is a very detail-oriented person, Iñigo is more of a macro-perspective guy.</p> <p>But the good thing is that we’re both quite vocal in sharing how we feel and have no problem in discussing and clarifying issues openly. Our “makeshift therapy sessions” this past month have been great to clear the air 😉. At the end of the day, it’s the mix of that macro and micro view of things that makes Wingle work.</p> <p>🚨 In the essence of time, we’ll keep the rest of the updates short:🚨</p> <p>📱 We’re launching the Android version of Wingle in the next couple of weeks</p> <p>👩‍✈️ We’ve launched an affiliate program for cabin crews, so they can promote Wingle and get rewarded for it (please share any cabin crew contacts)</p> <p>📸 Social Media activation is live as of Monday 10th (check @lets_wingle)</p> <p>🎬 We had our first Wingle “shooting” last week, generating some very cool content (big shoutout to our friends converted into actors for a day)</p> <p>😤 We’ve had to scramble last minute to change our ads campaign in an airline because they considered them too “aggressive”</p> <p>📆 Wingle was at South Summit in Madrid last week and we’ve been invited as startup to the World Aviation Festival in Amsterdam in October, one of the biggest global aviation fairs</p> <p>💻 We have a new, simple, cleaner and more functional web</p> <p>Ready for takeoff!</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lets-wingle_wingle-cockpit-diaries-episode-2-ready-activity-7206607457387786240-2L0y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">On LinkedIn</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Cockpit Diaries"/><category term="cockpit-diaries"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cockpit diaries series]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Episode 1: Calibrating the radar</title><link href="https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Episode 1: Calibrating the radar"/><published>2024-05-14T13:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T13:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cockpit.letswingle.com/blog/2024/cockpit-episode-1/"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first of our “cockpit diaries”; short posts where we want to keep you posted on the “behind the scenes” at Wingle and our learnings as we build a startup from the ground up. If you want a quick re-cap of what is Wingle and why we’re launching it, read the first comment below 👇</p> <p>This 1st episode, things “started to get real”; Wingle now feels like a real company. We accelerated the speed of everything, developed personality disorders from juggling all fonts of the business and realized that there are always things we had underestimated. But we also realized how sometimes, when working “normal” jobs, we don’t unlock the full potential of our personal networks. When you jump into the “deep end” and are forced to be creative, you realize the power of them.</p> <p>On a personal level, we felt the ups and downs, realized the importance of having a co-founder with whom to navigate the process and keep stability, and began building a work/life routine that works, gauging what feels right and what doesn’t. This is still WIP by the way.</p> <p>Keep reading below for what we’ve been up to…</p> <p>🛫 The ups:</p> <p>✅Secured advertising agreement with an European airline for summer; +160k passengers will see Wingle as soon as they board their flight</p> <p>✅Built a super team of creatives, content creators and social media partners to drive the launch campaign</p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pabloamade/">Pablo Amade</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wearecursiva/">Cursiva</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertomirandapoveda/">Alberto Miranda</a></p> <p>✅Applied for certification as “emerging company” by ENISA</p> <p>✅Finalizing 100k EUR investment round (last couple of tickets remaining)</p> <p>✅iOS app is live and working; Android version is WIP for summer launch</p> <p>✅Evolved technology using mesh networks to cover wide-body airplanes</p> <p>✅“Wingle Meeting Points” concept in development (stay tuned for more ;))</p> <p>✅Began developing a B2B value proposition. Wingle is born with a B2C aspiration, but we cannot close the door to a B2B offering</p> <p>🛬 The learnings:</p> <p>💡 Always have a plan B. We thought we had the best team member ready to join Wingle, but it all fell apart last minute. Thankfully we had plan B in place with our external partners</p> <p>💡 Things move painfully slow: while our decisions and responses take hours at most, many of the partners we talk to operate in slower dynamics and take long to answer (if they do at all). We need to have option 1, 2 and 3 in parallel. Option 2 is better than no option</p> <p>💡 Block time to think: there’s so much to do, so many things to execute, that we sometimes forgot about blocking quality time to think about the product, direction and bigger picture</p> <p>💡 Get rid of the fear of rejection. After +200 cold emails where we’ve been left as “read” in most, the fear of rejection and (incorrect) expectation that most people will be willing to talk to you has disappeared.
